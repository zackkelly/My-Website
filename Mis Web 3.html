<P> When Iâ€™m riding, my mind is not focused on anything but the trail in front of me. Not a problem in the world, just total freedom. Snowboarding is a way for me to destress myself and clear my mind of any dilemma. For me, there are two sides of snowboarding. One that brings my mind to a state of peace that is unexplainable, the other an extreme slopestyle side that gives me an adrenaline rush like no other. Calm curves across the trails are the gateway to some of the most peaceful afternoons I've ever had. On the other hand, terrain park laps have brought me some of my most exhilarating times in life. .</P>
