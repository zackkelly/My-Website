<P> I played lacrosse for about 8 years, year-round. I played in highschool for the Westford Academy Grey Ghosts, and for a club team named Team Central. Playing both indoor and outdoor provided me with the opportunity to play all year. I had a few offers to extend my carrer to the college level, but I decided to focus on my studies and go to the University of Maine.</P>
